                        Welcome to GUESSS India, a trailblazing chapter in the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit
                        Students' Survey (GUESSS).

                        GUESSS India is not just a survey; it's an opportunity to amplify India's voice on the global
                        stage,
                        contributing to a collective understanding of student entrepreneurship that transcends borders.
                        Together, we embark on a journey of discovery, empowerment, and shaping the future of
                        innovation.

                        At the heart of GUESSS India lies an intricate exploration of research topics that unravel the
                        complex web of factors influencing student entrepreneurship. We delve into aspects such as
                        entrepreneurial intentions, attitudes, motivations, and challenges faced by students. Our aim is
                        not
                        only to understand the current landscape but also to contribute to a deeper comprehension of how
                        educational institutions, cultural factors, and economic conditions shape the entrepreneurial
                        spirit.

                        Data forms the bedrock of GUESSS India's research journey. By gathering information from
                        students
                        across various universities in India, we not only paint a vivid picture of the present but also
                        facilitate longitudinal analysis that unveils trends and transformations over time. This
                        commitment
                        to data-driven insights equips us with the tools to identify opportunities, challenges, and best
                        practices that can foster a thriving ecosystem for student entrepreneurs.

                    As the largest international research initiative focused on student entrepreneurship, GUESSS has
                    been shaping the landscape since its inception in 2003. It's a story of collaboration, exploration,
                    and the pursuit of understanding the dynamic world of student-led innovation and enterprise. The
                    GUESSS saga began in 2003 through the partnership of two distinguished Swiss institutions, the
                    University of St. Gallen and the University of Bern. This collaborative endeavor embarked on a
                    mission to unravel the intricacies of student entrepreneurship, igniting a global movement that has
                    now spanned over two decades.

                    Since its inception, GUESSS has journeyed through nine data collection waves, leaving behind a trail
                    of insights and revelations. Each wave has contributed to a deeper understanding of student
                    entrepreneurship, guiding academic discourse and inspiring innovative policies around the world.

                    2021 marked a milestone as GUESSS encompassed 58 countries in its survey, illustrating its global
                    reach and impact. In 2023, the GUESSS spotlight turns to India. Indian universities will join the
                    survey for the very first time, bringing the nation's rich entrepreneurial spirit to the forefront
                    of global exploration.
